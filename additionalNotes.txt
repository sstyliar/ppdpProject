This project was developed using the Python programming language. The class Ppdp serves as the entry point of the project and requires a configuration object to be injected into it to populate the appropriate data. After loading data from their respective CSV files, the script transforms them into NumPy dataframes.
It then creates a taxonomy tree with two levels of generalization for each field requiring generalization, implementing different generalization logic depending on the datatype of each field.
Subsequently, the script utilizes the taxonomy tree to perform the generalization logic one level at a time, starting from the root of each generalization branch, which is represented by the 'any' value.
It calculates various generalization metrics, such as k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, Entropy l-Diversity, and Information Loss. Additionally, the script evaluates the likelihood of identifying individuals with known field values as having a specific disease and assesses the certainty of diagnosing someone's disease by cross-referencing both lists.
Finally, the script generates a PDF report that includes all computed data.
